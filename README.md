### Hi there 👋
# Welcome to Mohammed Radwan! 🚀

This repository showcases my expertise as an Artificial Intelligence engineer, specializing in Python, NLP, deep learning, and machine learning. Here, you'll find an assortment of projects that demonstrate my skills in AI and highlight my commitment to delivering high-quality solutions.

## About Me

I am a passionate AI engineer with a deep understanding of various machine learning techniques and natural language processing algorithms. My proficiency in Python enables me to develop efficient and robust applications. I have a solid track record of successfully executed projects, encompassing areas such as sentiment analysis, text classification, deep neural networks, and more.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects:

1. Reinforcement-OpenAI-Gym-CartPole : a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the cart and pole balancing problem using the OpenAI Gym environment.
2. Time Series Analysis : Time Series Using SARIMAX Model.
3. Question_Answering with RNN : Question-answering model using a combination of GRU layers and bilinear similarity layers.
4. Iris-Classification :in this project, we will compare and contrast the performance of three different learning models on a common and publicly available dataset.
